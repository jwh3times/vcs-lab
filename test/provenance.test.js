/**
 * Authorship provenance (FR-ID-08, FR-TRUST-04).
 *
 * The requirement exists because Git records authorship at commit granularity
 * and reconstructs line attribution heuristically, so attribution degrades
 * through exactly the operations this tool performs: cherry-pick, causal
 * rebase, reconciliation, and squash landing. The tests that matter here are
 * the ones that follow a declaration through a rewrite and then check that
 * stock Git has lost what vcs-lab kept.
 *
 * The second half of the requirement is a discipline rather than a feature:
 * provenance is *declared, never inferred*. A test asserts that a commit
 * carrying an ordinary `Co-Authored-By` trailer produces no provenance record,
 * because reading that trailer as a role would be a guess wearing the costume
 * of a reading.
