# ADR-0021: Give failures a versioned, machine-readable envelope

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Date:** 2026-08-31
- **Owners:** Repository maintainers
- **Related requirements:** FR-GIT-06, NFR-SEC-03, NFR-TEST-03
- **Tracked by:** [issue #12](https://github.com/jwh3times/vcs-lab/issues/12)

## Context

`--json` has no effect on the failure path. Every error leaves through one
boundary in `bin/vlab.js`, which prints `vlab: <message>` and an optional
detail line to stderr and sets an exit code. stdout stays empty. A caller that
asked for JSON gets JSON on success and prose on failure, and the only
machine-readable signal is an exit code that is `1` for nearly everything,
because `CliError` defaults to it.

This was tolerable while failures were mostly "you did something wrong."
[ADR-0020](0020-freeze-per-family-compatibility-and-resource-bounds.md)
changed that: refusal is now a *contractual* outcome with a specified cause.
An unreadable schema version, a record of the wrong family in a store, and an
exceeded resource bound are each a deliberate, documented behavior, and each
implies a different response:

| Cause | What a caller should do |
| --- | --- |
| Unknown schema version | Retry with the build that wrote the record |
| Wrong-family record in a store | Stop and surface to a human |
| Resource bound exceeded | Reduce the input, or raise the bound deliberately |
| Stale forecast or plan | Regenerate and re-approve |
| Anything else | Treat as a defect |

The compatibility contract specifies precisely which refusal happens, and
automation cannot read it. `docs/conformance/` pins the success path field by
field; the failure path has no contract at all. That asymmetry is the gap.

This ADR records the decision to close it and the shape of the contract. It is
**Proposed**: no implementation exists, and none should begin until it is
accepted, because it publishes a vocabulary that then has to be maintained.

## Decision

Failures gain a versioned envelope, `vcs-lab.error/v1`, and every raised error
carries a stable classification code.

1. **`CliError` carries a `code`** — a kebab-case slug from a published,
   closed vocabulary — alongside its existing `message`, `details`, and
   `exitCode`. A raise site without a code is a defect the suite catches;
   `unknown` is not a permitted value.
2. **The vocabulary is a published contract**, catalogued beside the record
   families in `docs/schemas/` and versioned with the envelope. Adding a code
   is an additive change inside `v1`; removing one, or changing what a code
   means, is a version bump. This mirrors the compatibility rules ADR-0020
   fixed for record families.
3. **The envelope prints on stdout when the invocation requested `--json`**,
   as `{schema, code, message, details, exitCode}`, and stderr stays empty in
   that mode. Without `--json`, today's stderr prose is unchanged. Automation
   parses one stream; humans keep the stream they read.
4. **Exit codes stay coarse.** The `code` field carries the classification;
   exit codes remain "0 success, non-zero failure" plus the few distinct
   values that already exist. Encoding a growing vocabulary into an 8-bit
   exit status is not worth the compatibility cost.
5. **The conformance fixtures extend to the failure path**, so a raise site
   that loses its code, or a code that stops appearing, fails the suite the
   way a dropped output member already does.

### Deliberately unresolved here

- **Pre-dispatch failures stay text.** `--json` is parsed per command, after
  the command word, so an unknown command or a malformed global flag fails
  before any `--json` is in scope. Those keep prose on stderr; the envelope
  covers failures from dispatch onward. Making the flag global would change
  argument parsing for every command and is a larger change than this buys.
- **Whether codes are namespaced per record family** (matching
  `RECORD_FAMILIES`) or live in one flat namespace. The flat namespace is
  simpler and probably right, but the question should be settled against a
  real enumeration of raise sites, not in advance.
- **Whether `details` stays free text** or gains structured members for the
  cases that have them (the bound that was exceeded, the versions a build
  reads). Structured detail is more useful and more expensive to freeze.

## Constraints

- The vocabulary is closed and published; a code that is not in the catalog is
  a defect, not an escape hatch.
- Human output does not change. This adds a mode; it does not reword prose
  people already read.
- No code may leak repository content, file contents, or commit messages
  (NFR-SEC-02); a code plus already-shown identifiers only.
- Adding the envelope must not change any exit code that exists today.

## Consequences

### Positive

- The refusals ADR-0020 made contractual become machine-readable, so a caller
  can distinguish "your build is too old" from "your input is too big" without
  matching English.
- The failure path gains the same kind of pinned contract the success path got
  in phase 0b, closing the FR-GIT-06 asymmetry.
- A native or gateway implementation has one error contract to reproduce
  rather than a set of message strings.

### Negative

- A published vocabulary is a maintenance obligation: every new raise site
  needs a code, and codes cannot be renamed casually.
- Every `CliError` raise site is touched, which is broad if shallow.
- Two output modes on the failure path is more surface than one.

## Alternatives considered

- **Leave it.** Exit code plus prose is what most CLIs do, and FR-GIT-06 is
  arguably satisfied because the requirement speaks to state, not failure.
  Rejected because ADR-0020 made the *cause* of a refusal part of the
  contract, and a contract that cannot be read is not much of one.
- **Distinct exit codes per cause.** Conventional and needs no envelope, but
  256 values, no room for detail, and every new cause is a compatibility
  event.
- **Structured errors on stderr.** Conventional for diagnostics, but a caller
  parsing stdout for success and stderr for failure has to handle two streams
  and two formats; and stderr is where Git's own noise already goes.
- **Reuse an existing convention (RFC 9457 problem details).** Designed for
  HTTP, carries URI-shaped type fields this project has no use for, and would
  import a vocabulary rather than publish one that matches the record
  families.

## Implementation map

- Decision and open questions: this ADR, issue #12
- Error boundary: `bin/vlab.js`, `src/errors.js`
- Raise sites: every `CliError` in `src/`
- Published vocabulary: `docs/schemas/` beside the record families
- Coverage: `docs/conformance/` extended to the failure path
