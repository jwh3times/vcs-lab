# Compatibility, migration, and resource bounds

This document is the published contract for how vcs-lab treats a stored record
it did not write: what may change inside one schema version, which versions each
family reads and writes, what a reader does with a version it does not know, and
how large a record may be before it is refused or quarantined. It extends the
[schema catalog](README.md) (ADR-0015 phase 0b, issue #11 item 4) and is decided
by [ADR-0020](../adr/0020-freeze-per-family-compatibility-and-resource-bounds.md).

**Authority.** `RECORD_FAMILIES` and `RESOURCE_BOUNDS` in `src/schemas.js` are
the runtime authority; the tables below are their published description.
`test/schema-compatibility.test.js` fails the suite when this document and the
runtime registry disagree, and exercises each disposition against the real CLI.

## 1. What may change inside one version

Catalog documents are open: a reader tolerates unknown members and must never
rewrite a record to drop them. Within one `family/vN`, a writer may:

- add an optional member;
- add a value to a member whose vocabulary readers already treat as opaque;
- widen an accepted value (a nullable member that was never null before);
- relax a resource bound upward.

A change that is none of these requires a new version `vN+1`:

- removing or renaming a member, or making an optional member required;
- changing a member's type, cardinality, or unit;
- changing the meaning of an existing value, or narrowing an accepted set;
- changing any byte layout a hash or signature covers.

Two consequences follow. A reader must not treat "member absent" as an error
unless the catalog document lists it in `required`, and a writer must not emit a
member whose meaning an older reader would get wrong — that is a version bump,
not an addition.

## 2. Version rules per family

`Written` is what this build emits, `also read` is what it additionally accepts,
and `unknown version` is what it does with anything else in that family. A
version in `also read` is migrated forward as section 3 describes.

| Family | Scope | Written | Also read | Unknown version | Store |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `vcs-lab.note` | note-container | v1 | — | ignore | refs/notes/vcs-lab note blobs |
| `vcs-lab.landing` | note-record | v1 | — | quarantine | refs/notes/vcs-lab note containers |
| `vcs-lab.application` | note-record | v1, v4 | — | quarantine | refs/notes/vcs-lab note containers |
| `vcs-lab.reconciliation` | note-record | v6 | — | quarantine | refs/notes/vcs-lab note containers |
| `vcs-lab.rebase-application` | note-record | v1 | — | quarantine | refs/notes/vcs-lab note containers |
| `vcs-lab.rebase` | note-record | v1 | — | quarantine | refs/notes/vcs-lab note containers |
| `vcs-lab.resolution` | note-record | v1 | — | quarantine | refs/notes/vcs-lab note containers |
| `vcs-lab.reconciliation-operation` | private | v4 | — | refuse | `<git dir>/vcs-lab/reconciliation.json` |
| `vcs-lab.rebase-operation` | private | v1 | — | refuse | `<git dir>/vcs-lab/rebase.json` |
| `vcs-lab.forecast` | private | v2 | v1 | refuse | `<git dir>/vcs-lab/forecasts/<id>.json` |
| `vcs-lab.rebase-forecast` | private | v1 | — | refuse | `<git dir>/vcs-lab/forecasts/<id>.json` |
| `vcs-lab.workspaces` | shared-local | v1 | — | refuse | `<common dir>/vcs-lab/workspaces.json` |
| `vcs-lab.workspace` | shared-local | v1 | — | refuse | entries of `<common dir>/vcs-lab/workspaces.json` |
| `vcs-lab.spec-manifest` | tracked | v3 | v1, v2 | refuse | `.vcs-lab/specs/**` |
| `vcs-lab.metadata-envelope` | envelope | v1 | — | refuse | `manifest.json` of a metadata export directory |

`vcs-lab.application` writes two versions on purpose: `vlab cherry-pick`
publishes `v1` and reconciliation publishes the richer `v4`. Both are current;
neither supersedes the other.

CLI-output families (`vcs-lab.merge-plan/v1` and the rest of the catalog's
CLI-output table) are not persisted and carry no compatibility rule. They are
produced fresh by the command that prints them, so a consumer sees exactly the
version of the build it ran.

### Why the dispositions differ by scope

The rule follows from who wrote the record and what is lost by guessing.

- **Shared-portable notes are quarantined, never refused.** They arrive by
  `git fetch` from clones that may run a newer vcs-lab, so an unknown version is
  an ordinary event, not a fault. An unknown record is reported by
  `vlab metadata status`, excluded from coverage proof and planning, and left on
  disk untouched. A single bad record from a peer must never stop local work,
  and untrusted input must never be interpreted (NFR-SEC-03).
- **Note containers are ignored and protected.** A container of another version
  yields no records, and `appendNote` refuses to rewrite it: `git notes add -f`
  replaces the whole blob, so publishing a receipt into a container this build
  cannot read would destroy the peer's data. Publishing fails closed instead.
  Unparsable note text is different — it is preserved as one opaque
  `legacy-note` record so a rewrite keeps it.
- **Worktree-private journals and forecasts are refused.** Resuming an
  operation means acting on a queue, a cursor, and recovery fields; interpreting
  those from a version we do not understand could move refs the writer never
  intended. The state is local and disposable, so refusing costs only the
  operation: recover with the build that wrote it, or delete the file.
- **The shared-local workspace registry is refused.** It is the only record of
  which worktrees vcs-lab materialized, and every mutation rewrites the whole
  file, so consuming a version we do not understand would silently drop its
  members.
- **Tracked spec manifests are refused forward and migrated backward.** They are
  committed, derived, and rebuildable, so an unreadable one is repaired by
  re-indexing rather than guessed at.
- **Envelopes are refused.** Import is an explicit, auditable act on untrusted
  input; a version mismatch is reported rather than partially applied.

## 3. Migration

Only two families read a version they do not write.

**`vcs-lab.spec-manifest` v1 and v2 migrate forward to v3 on write, not on
read.** `materializeManifest` (`src/specs.js`) accepts v1 and v2 and returns
their materialized view with the stored schema unchanged, so a read never
rewrites a committed file. Every cache-hit predicate in `indexSpecWithContext`
requires v3, so the next `vlab spec index` of that file always rebuilds and
serializes v3, reporting the old identifier as `migratedFrom`. Logical IDs
survive: `priorManifestView` reconstructs the older inline block list and seeds
the new sparse manifest's `idOverrides` from it (FR-SPEC-04). One v1-only
compatibility shim remains in `revisionStageFromObjects`: a v1 manifest's
`sourceHash` may also match the CRLF-normalized source, because v1 hashed the
pre-normalization bytes.

**`vcs-lab.forecast` v1 is read but never written and never rewritten.** A v1
forecast is accepted by `forecastForPlan` and read field by field; it is not
back-filled, and the staleness and fingerprint checks apply to it unchanged. It
has no catalog document; the catalog lists it as superseded.

No migration ever runs implicitly on a shared-portable record. Note records are
migrated only by publishing a new record, never by rewriting a peer's note.

## 4. Resource bounds

Every bound is a constant in `RESOURCE_BOUNDS` (`src/schemas.js`), not
configuration, so every implementation of this contract agrees. Bounds are
checked before a record is interpreted — a note over `noteContainerBytes` is
never parsed — and each fails closed in the way its scope requires: a
shared-portable input is quarantined, and a worktree-private, shared-local,
tracked, or imported input refuses the command.

| Bound | Bytes or count | Applies to | On excess |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `noteContainerBytes` | 8388608 | One `refs/notes/vcs-lab` note blob | Quarantine: no records, `oversize-record` warning from `vlab metadata status`, and `appendNote` refuses to rewrite it |
| `noteContainerRecords` | 4096 | Records in one note container | Quarantine, as above; an append that would cross the bound is refused |
| `localStateBytes` | 67108864 | One `vcs-lab/**` JSON file in the git or common directory | Refuse before reading the file |
| `specManifestBytes` | 8388608 | One `.vcs-lab/specs/**` manifest, in the working tree or at a revision | Refuse |
| `envelopeManifestBytes` | 16777216 | `manifest.json` of a metadata envelope | Refuse |
| `envelopeBundleBytes` | 2147483648 | The `objects.bundle` size an envelope declares | Refuse |
| `envelopeRecords` | 1000000 | Records one envelope declares | Refuse |

`readJson` in `src/store.js` is the single reader for every worktree-private and
shared-local document, which is why `localStateBytes` is enforced there and
covers the reconciliation journal, the rebase journal, every stored forecast, and
the workspace registry at once. The same reader refuses malformed JSON as a
domain error naming the file rather than surfacing a bare `SyntaxError`.

### Transport bounds

These bound the Git plumbing rather than a record family, and are enforced in
`src/git.js` and its workers. They are listed here so the complete set of limits
is in one place.

| Bound | Value | On excess |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `maxBuffer` for every Git process | 256 MiB | The command fails with the Git invocation error |
| `SESSION_TIMEOUT_MS` | 60000 ms | Object session: disabled, reads fall back to one process per query. Merge-tree session: the forecast fails |
| `SESSION_INFO_BUFFER_BYTES` | 1 MiB | Object session reports `response-too-large`, is disabled, and falls back |
| `SESSION_CONTENT_BUFFER_BYTES` | 64 MiB | As above; contents are base64 in the response, so the effective object ceiling per batch is lower |
| `MERGE_TREE_RESPONSE_BYTES` | 64 KiB | The merge-tree session fails; there is no fallback for it |
| Worker stderr capture | 64 KiB | Silently truncated, keeping the tail |

### Bounds that deliberately do not exist yet

Naming these is part of the contract; they are growth limits, not safety limits,
and each needs a retention design rather than a constant.

- No cap on the number of notes, note targets, or causal records in a
  repository. `vlab metadata status` reads every note in one batch and holds the
  whole inventory in memory.
- No cap on operation-journal queue length, on the number of stored forecasts
  (nothing prunes `<git dir>/vcs-lab/forecasts/`), on registered workspaces, or
  on retained checkpoint-history and resolution refs.
- No cap on tracked path count, spec file size, or blocks per document outside
  the benchmark commands.

The per-file `localStateBytes` bound is what keeps each of these from becoming
an unbounded single read today. ADR-0013's incremental-catalog row is the
decision point at which repository-wide retention and pagination get designed.

## 5. Changing this contract

A change to any table here changes a published contract, so it needs the same
treatment as a schema change (NFR-TEST-03): a new ADR when it reverses a
durable decision, a version bump when it breaks a reader, a migration test when
it changes what an older record means, and an update to `RECORD_FAMILIES` or
`RESOURCE_BOUNDS` in the same commit — the suite fails if the runtime and this
document disagree.

## 6. Known inconsistency

`vlab metadata validate` reports an unsupported `vcs-lab.spec-manifest` version
as a warning and keeps scanning, while `materializeManifest` refuses the same
manifest with an error. This is deliberate — validation is a report over
everything present, and only a command that must interpret a manifest fails —
but the two severities are worth knowing about when reading a validation report.
