/**
 * The closed error-code vocabulary (ADR-0021, issue #12). A code names *why* a
 * command refused, so a caller can decide what to do without matching English
 * prose. The value is the caller-facing meaning: what the code says happened
 * and what a caller should do about it.
 *
 * **The namespace is flat.** ADR-0021 left this open, to be settled against a
 * real enumeration rather than in advance. The enumeration settles it: codes
 * cluster by *cause* — usage, repository state, Git transport, schema — and a
 * single cause routinely spans several record families. `resource-bound-exceeded`
 * covers notes, envelopes, and manifests alike, so a per-family namespace would
 * split one caller response across several names and still not tell a caller
 * anything the family-carrying `message` does not.
 *
 * Adding a code is an additive change inside `v1`. Removing one, or changing
 * what a code means, is a version bump — the same rule ADR-0020 fixed for
 * record families.
 *
 * A raise site with no code, or with a code outside this map, is a defect:
 * `test/error-envelope.test.js` scans every `new CliError` in `src/` and fails
 * the suite. There is deliberately no `unknown` member to fall back to.
